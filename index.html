                        <h3>THE HASSAN II MOSQUE IN CASABLANCA</h3>
                        <h1>Wondering how does it look inside</h1>
                        <p>The Hassan II Mosque or Grand Mosque is located in Casablanca and is the biggest and most beautiful mosque in
                            Morocco.
                            It's also the only mosque in the country that non-Muslims can visit, and it's definitely worth a stop in
                            Casablanca,
                            even if you're just going to go on a tour of the building.</p>
                            <p class="hidden1">
                                This mosque is extremely large and intricately built, with soaring ceilings and hand-carved stucco and cedar on the
                                arches and ceilings. There's a water feature in the centre of the main prayer hall with incredible views over the sea. <br>
                                <br>
                                The largest working mosque in Africa and the 7th biggest mosque in the world, it welcomes more than 100,000 visitors
                                during the month of Ramadan.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Visits to the mosque are available by guided tour only, and times are generally at 9am, 10am, 11am, and 3pm (though I
                                would definitely recommend checking the current schedule before you go). The cost is 130 dirhams (around $13), and the
                                tour takes just under an hour.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                While it is appropriate to wear modest clothing to the mosque, no particular dress code or head scarves are required for
                                visitors.

                        <h3>THE SAHARA DESERT</h3>
                        <h1>Have you visited a desert before</h1>
                        <p>the Sahara. Most people can only dream of visiting this wild and vast desert of sand dunes and experiencing Berber
                        culture, but if you come to Morocco, you have a rare chance to explore this natural wonder.</p>
                        <p class="hidden2">
                            The Sahara Desert starts in the city of Merzouga, very close to the Algerian border. The wind-blown sand dunes here,
                            known locally as Erg Chebbi, are the perfect setting for glamping in a luxury desert camp.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            When you arrive in Merzouga, you will meet your Berber guide, mount your camel, and ride away into the sand dunes.
                            You'll reach your luxury desert camp in about 1.5 hours to walk the sand at sunset and enjoy a delicious dinner before
                            listening to your Berber guides play the drums and sing music around the fire.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Finally, go stargazing before retiring to your beautiful, cosy tent, with a real bed, electricity, WIFI, running water,
                            and a full bathroom.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The whole experience is one that feels right out of a dream, the amber sand dunes standing tall and glowing in the
                            evening light; the camels being led by men in turbans; and the sound of nomads singing in the night. It's an experience
                            you will never forget.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Although a tour out to the Sahara desert involves 8-10 hours of driving from either Fes or Marrakech, this bucket-list
                            experience is definitely worth the long journey.

                        <h1>Want to know the beauty of blue</h1>
                        <p>Chefchaouen is one of the most striking little cities you will ever meet, mostly thanks to its very unique
                        old medina, where every wall, door and stairway is painted blue..</p>
                        <p class="hidden3">
                            Also known as the {Blue City} or the {Blue Pearl of Morocco}, Chefchaouen is located in northern Morocco, between Fes
                            and Tangier. The main thing to do here is wander the medina and marvel at her beauty. The turquoise and cobalt
                            colourscheme gives the city a special ambiance.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As you explore, you'll discover streets decorated with colourful baskets and flower pots, fragrant spice markets,
                            flowering trees, hanging carpets, and other novelties that coordinate beautifully with the blue walls.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The other main thing to do in Chefchaouen is hike up to the Spanish Mosque that sits on a hill overlooking the city and
                            the valley. The panoramic views of the blue facades and rooftops are just incredible. For the best views and nicest
                            light, walk up in the late afternoon.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            If you're up for more adventures further afield, escape to the nearby Rif mountains where you can walk amongst the olive
                            groves.
